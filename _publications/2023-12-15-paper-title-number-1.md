title: "Multiomic approach and Mendelian randomization analysis identify causal associations between blood biomarkers and subcortical brain structure volumes"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'This research employs a Mendelian Randomization approach to investigate the causal associations between biomarkers and subcortical brain structure volumes. The results reveal that eleven proteins and six metabolites have significant associations with these brain structures. Our findings offer insights into the mechanisms by which brain structure volumes are influenced during the development of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, these results identify potential treatment targets for future clinical trials.'
