Abstract: Common neurodevelopmental disorders such as Tourette Syndrome (TS), Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are often comorbid. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous variants associated with the different neurodevelopmental disorders, but the relationship with protein expression is unknown. Here, we perform a Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to identify putative causal relationships between the plasma proteome and the different childhood neurodevelopmental disorders. Exposure data were extracted from a large GWAS of 2,994 plasma proteins in 3,301 subjects of European descent, while outcome data were obtained from GWAS summary statistics of the various disorders from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) software is used for the analysis, and the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) instruments are chosen at a p-value threshold of 1e-05. The results of this analysis could identify proteins causally associated with the disorders that could potentially be used as novel drug targets for the treatment of these conditions.
